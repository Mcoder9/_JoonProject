Review Bot
Bots will be logging into http://joonbud.com/ (this url is also configurable).
There will be config file of bots' login credentials.



We will have one bot log in.
This bot will then search for the professor (full value; example: Ruth Wrightsman BIO1C
) on this page: http://joonbud.com/professors/categories/saddleback-college.2/ (this url will be configurable).



After finding the professor with right class, it will click on it and then it will take you to a page like this: http://joonbud.com/professors/reyes-hist.16/



We have to check for review duplicates first by going to this url slug http://joonbud.com/professors/reyes-hist.16/reviews (Note: If the professor does not have reviews, that url slug will just redirect the bot to this page http://joonbud.com/professors/reyes-hist.16/.)



On this reviews page, it will check for duplicates by checking the "review comment." This can be done by the script keeping track of already used review comments in a log file.
***IMPORTANT*** This review page may have pagination if it has too many reviews. You can see an example here: http://icecream.me/uploads/287b3b755c295c112636e60d5a445206.png
The live url of this site to grab the pagination button class can be taken from here: https://xenforo.com/community/resources/s9e-media-sites.5973/reviews
This url is a different site but it uses the same software and same css class "pageNav-jump pageNav-jump--next" for the pagination button.



Now it will go back to this url: http://joonbud.com/professors/reyes-hist.16/
After it screens for duplicates, and if there is no duplicate, then the user will leave a review in the class by click on the "Leave a rating" button or by going to this url slug: http://joonbud.com/professors/reyes-hist16.15/rate



After leaving the review, it will log out and then login with new user and use the next row in the csv file.
