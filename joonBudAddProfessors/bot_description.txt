Note: Credentials will be given to you in chat.

Bot will be logging into http://joonbud.com/
The user credentials should be configurable as maybe I need to change user in the future. But we will be only using one user for this bot.

Then it will be going to a URL that is set in the config http://joonbud.com/professors/categories/saddleback-college.2/add
In other words, I will be able to change this url in the script before running it.

On this page:
1) It will click and choose the prefix first. It should only have one option for prefix.
2) It will copy the first column from the csv file and paste it into "title" which is next to the prefix.
3) It will copy the second column from the csv file and paste it into the "class" input row.
4) We will put a "-" (without quotes) in the "description" input textbox.
5) Then it will click save button.

Important:
We need to have a log of used "titles" where it will keep the bot from creating duplicate titles. SO if we already created a class with the title "Arnold McMahon LOGIC1" that we got from the csv file, it will not create another "Arnold McMahon LOGIC1" but it could create a "Arnold McMahon ECON101." Basically as long as it doesn't match the full title.

I will be running this script multiple times since the cvs file will be updated every now and then, and it will help to not have duplicates made when I rerun the bot.
